  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Colin Powell is a reporter, web developer and farmer in Castine, Maine. Sometimes his work shows up on github. Sometimes he hoards it so that he can release it all at once and hope nobody notices his terrible coding style. Mostly he's just working to get by though.</p>
  <p>Mostly what you'll find is that he's following/creating django apps and various great tools.</p>
