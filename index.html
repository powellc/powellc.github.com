  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Colin Powell is a reporter, web developer and farmer in {{ page.location }}. Sometimes his work shows up on github. Sometimes he hoards it so that he can release it all at once and hope nobody notices his terrible coding style. Though mostly he's just working to get by.</p>
  <p>What you'll find is that he's following/creating django apps and various other tools to make websites that interact with clients less painful to create and maintain.</p>
  <p>This is his personal blog. You can find out more about what he does at: <a href="http://onecardinal.com" class="onec-link">One Cardinal</a> or <a href="http://timberwyckfarm.com">Timberwyck Farm</a></p>.
