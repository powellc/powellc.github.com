So we’re thinking about paying a visit to Morocco for our Winter Break (which, given the weather around here lately feels more like it will be a spring break) at the end of February.  Pretty exciting stuff.  My sister, who is visiting next week is going to bring us a book on it and then it’s off to Fez or Marrakesh!

Also a little pointer for this whole online journal (or blog ~shutter~ if you must) thing, check out “Google Reader”:http://www.google.com/reader for a nice online feed reader.  You can then stop actually visiting sites and have them just land in your lap.
