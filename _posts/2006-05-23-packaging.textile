It seems packing is a theme in my life these days. Well, to be fair packing is usually an activity the precedes moving, of which a number of people in my life are in the process currently.

When I begin to move I am also bound to rediscover the beauty of Ebay. I accumulate a lot of redundant items over time. Multiple digital cameras, video game consoles that are never played and books — oh my, the books! As a result I’m left packing and packing, not just for myself, but for all my countless, and probably needless, things.
