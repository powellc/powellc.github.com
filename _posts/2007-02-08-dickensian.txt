We entered the Eternal City via Roma Termini, a modern-architecture afflicted train station that, whether by poor planning or beautiful civil engineering greets the weary traveller with not a garden or fountain or some such frivolity, but a massive slab of pavement full of buses and no discernably pedestrian-safe way to navigate through them.  If I had been hoping to live in this city, I believe I would have just gotten back on the train to Florence, but instead the sights are my goal, and I don’t have to like the city to enjoy some of the greatest achievments in human history.

As our visit landed us near New Year’s Eve without us realizing, sleeping arrangments were difficult to come by.  After following a recommendation from a full hostel, we arrived at the Stargate Hotel which proved to be not nearly as seedy as it looked, thank god.

_And that, my friends, is all I’ve got time for right now.  More embittered 19th century travelogue-esque writing may follow, who knows?_
