You’ll notice that, while this journal is meant for things specific to France and our travels within it, I have already posted once about the political environment in the US.  I am about to do so again, and I apologize. 

You see, that last post was about ignorant French people and I don’t want to give the impression that ignorance is unique to France or that the ills of ignorance are more acutely felt in France.  Enter “this”:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101509.html op-ed piece in the Post by Eric Foner.  Yes America, if we had a word in English like Franchouillard, it would become exhausted by use on our current president.

That is all.
