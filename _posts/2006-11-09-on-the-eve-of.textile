With the congressional elections ongoing in the U.S., it becomes difficult to recount in vivid detail the wonderful week-long break Emma and I took recently.  Our trip took us through a lot of tourist spots in Normandy and Brittany; we visited Giverny, Bayeux, Mont-St-Michel, Vannes, Carnac, Quimper, and Pointe du Raz, in that order.  We saw many amazing things and a lot of France’s beautiful countryside by train.  Of course, there are pictures too.  

And all this stuff will be noted and posted in time, but for now, because our lives have gotten quite hectic and we still don’t have Internet in our appartment, I just had to at least make mention of the elections.  While I actually consider myself somewhat of a conservative on fundamental issues, I must congratulate the Democratic party on a job well done.  This will make Bush a lame duck for the next year and a half and force him to actually address the flaws in his arguments and positions.  At least I hope.  Thank you to everyone who voted, and I’m ashamed to say it, but I didn’t vote absentee, mostly on account of not knowing which state to claim residency.  Oh well, thanks again, and this makes the 2008 elections that much more interesting.

(Also, can I just say that I like Montana’s choice of Tester?  He seems like a great breath of fresh air.)
