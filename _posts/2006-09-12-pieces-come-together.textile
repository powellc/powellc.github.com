Slowly our plans for France are becoming more concrete.  Often it is happening quicker than we would like, but I suppose if things like insurance were up to me I’d never actually get around to paying for it.  

The summer is winding down and I only have two more articles to write for Penobscot Bay Press before my tenure with them is over.  My boss has been so accommodating and nice that Emma and I are planning on bringing some baked goods over to Stonington tomorrow (the 13th) to thank him and say our goodbyes.  

I made my first contact with an English teacher at Jules Haag.  Her English is excellent and she has asked if I know anything about physics because one of her classes is also taking physics lessons in English.  I can only assume this means they speak better English than I do.  So now I need to brush up on my high school physics and French.

T minus 7 days till we leave, and I can’t wait, if only to get the transition over with and grow comfortable with living in Besançon.
