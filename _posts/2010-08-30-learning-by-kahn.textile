Have you heard of "Kahn Academy":http://www.kahnacademy.org ? You should, at least if you have an interest in learning some of the most basic (and often mildly advanced) math and science principals. An ex-hedge fund manager sits in his Silicon Valley home and scribbles math problems by scribbling on a surface that is really no more advanced than MS Paint.

The thing about it: He's really, really clear, doesn't try to be cute, and helps you understand. Oh, and his videos follow standard school curricula so you can follow along and practicaly move through a high school algebra or pre-calculus class in front of your computer.

This is great.
