Apparently Portland’s Chinatown is embarking on a brave new “experiment”:http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/12/where_the_sidewalk_ends.php in urban planning:  squares usable by both pedestrians and vehicles.  Turns out Besancon, France beat them to the punch on this one.  Honestly, so many streets around here are not-quite-pedestrian-malls that it can make walking stressful at times.

Of course, the advantage of pedestrian/vehicle streets is small streets and even smaller sidewalks becomeing larger by becoming vaguer.  I don’t think it will work in the States though.  Too many well-laid-out cities and not enough concentration of population.  Seriously, Besancon is about the size of Appleton, WI and has a decidedly larger and busier downtown area with older, smaller streets.  (Emma may disagree with me on this last point … )
