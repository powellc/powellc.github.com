Mother Theresa once shook hands with a dictator and praised his wife for her community outreach.  I realize it takes a lot to be good in this world, but clearly Theresa, here, was more of a politician than a saint.  That is, if she ever attains sainthood.  I would like to see those three miracles.  I bet they are all going to have been in third world countries, carefully out of the sight of any sort of electronic historical documentation devices like a camera. 


I got that little tidbit of Theresa trivia from the book &laquo;Mountains Beyond Mountains&raquo; which is about a man, his mission and Haiti.  It really is fantastic and can either serve as a stimulant to encourage one to go out and help change the world.  Or it can work as a depressive agent, showing just how little the things one does for entertainment matter to the 3,000,000,000+ people living in abject poverty in the world.
